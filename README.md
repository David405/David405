## Hi 👋, I'm David Asamonye

Seasoned Software Engineer with 6 years of extensive experience in blockchain development and backend engineering. Expertise in Rust, Solidity,
Golang, JavaScript, and TypeScript. Proven ability to design, develop, and deploy secure, scalable blockchain-based applications. Adept at leading
and contributing to complex open-source projects with a focus on decentralized finance (DeFi) and advanced blockchain technologies.

- 🔭  Currently exploring **Account and Chain Abstraction alongside AI Agents**, as I believe these technologies will be pivotal in scaling blockchain adoption to a billion users by simplifying cross-chain interactions and enhancing user experiences through intelligent automation.
